      400 years ago, Josef was born in a small village in some unknown country. After a dragon attack claimed his family, Josef went and found the dragon responsible, and fought him. The dragon, Igneous, saw the strength Josef had, and decided to raise him as his own. Josef lived with Igneous and learned the ways of the fire dragon, and travelled this unknown land helping people however he could.

      <p> In a giant battle between magic users, Josef was sent spiraling through space and time, and landed in Danville, located in the Tri-State area.

        As a regular platypus, Josef didn't do much. He was just a regular platypus after all.

        Eventually, as he wandered around Danville, he was found by the Organization Without a Cool Acronym (O.W.C.A) and trained as a special agent. And regular Josef became <b><em>Josef The Platypus</em></b>.

        As a special agent, Josef was sent to fight Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, whose hi-jinks sometimes threatened the safety of the entire Tri-State area, while others were just downright nonsense. It turns out, Josef the Platypus was simply helping Dr. Doofenshmirtz process out his childhood traumas in a healthy way. After a few years, through the help of Josef, Heinz Doofenshmirtz became a high school science teacher, helping the youth of Danville become more innovative and inventive, creating many technological wonders we have today, like heated mattress pads.
