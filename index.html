    <h1>The Truth about Josef</h1>
    <div id="childhood">
      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <img id="first grade me" src="./1st-grade-pic.jpg"  class="right" alt="author in first grade"/>
      On the first of May 1973, I was born on a C-5 over the Atlantic Ocean. I was a month over due
      and my family jokes that it was just to avoid being born in Florida. As a child I spent most of my life
      living on US military bases in Europe with brief stints in Korea, Okinawa, Philippines and one summer in
      Australia. At most bases access to the &quot;off-base&quot; or civilian world was limited. This was due to a
      wide variety of cultural, societal or environmental differences and hazards that the US Department of Defense deemed
      unsuitable for dependent minors. This was alleviated by the self contained cities that bases are. One of those activities
      was scouting. I truly enjoyed every aspect of scouting.  Most of my time outside of school was spent in scouting related
      activities.

      /p>
      <p> The first time I was in the US I was 14.  I came to Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico.  Some people
      come to America and they get to see the Statue of Liberty. Others are welcomed by the Golden Gate Bridge.
      I got &quot;Chevy on a stick&quot;.

      <h2>Adulthood</h2>

         &quot;I am my beloved and my beloved is mine"/>
      <p>
        My first forays into academia were as an undergraduate at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma.
        To say it was traumatizing is an understatement.  I wasn't prepared to shift from Living in Europe and
        the order of the military bases to the chaos of civilian life punctuated by a community where everything
        I am is offensive.  My first year I worked in the engineering computer lab.  It was unfathomably depressing
        so I became an RA.  After a semester of babysitting, I gave up.  It was at this time i took my first job in
        corrections at the county level.  I spent my weekends booking classmates for public intoxication mostly
        and overseeing drunk tank operations.  I found I enjoyed the work and switched majors, during my senior year
        of all things, to Criminal Justice and Pre-Law.  I became a seven-year senior.  In the end I left with three
        degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        After college I decided I didn't want to work at the county level and especially in Oklahoma.  So I appllied
        to the Federal Law Enforcment Training Center <abbr>FLETC.</abbr>  After twenty weeks of training, I took my
        first federal position in Molokai, HI.  I was there three years before moving to Federal Correctional Center <abbr>
        FCC</abbr> Brooklyn.  While I was there I worked on and got 2 masters degrees from New York University
        and City University of New York, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. My <abbr> NYU</abbr> is in
        Psychometrics and my <abbr>JJCCJ</abbr> degree is in Forensic Psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the course work for my Doctorate, I was transferred to the Federal Intake and Assessment
        Center<abbr>FIAC</abbr> Raymond in Southern Maine.  It was here that I adopted my son, Ari.  I was at <abbr>FIAC
        </abbr> Raymond until 2007 when I took the Wardens' Board, passed and was made underwarden at the old
        Federal Inmate Detention and Transfer Center<abbr>FIDTC</abbr> Albuquerque. In 2008 I met my Husband Noah In 2013
        I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and was medically retired. In 2015 several things happened.  In March I
        finished and defended my doctoral dissertation on &quot;Victomological Origination and Predeterminance in Nonviolent
        Nonfamilial Child Sex Offenders&quot;, I was raised a master Mason and Married my husband. My <abbr>MS</abbr> went into
        remission during the pandemic and was cleared to return to work in March of this year.  So I enrolled in this class.
