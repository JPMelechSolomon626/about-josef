      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <p>On the first of May 1973, I was born on a C-5 over the Atlantic Ocean.  I was a month over due
      and my family jokes that it was just to avoid being born in Florida.  As a child I spent most of my life
      living on US military bases in Europe with brief stints in Korea, Okinawa, Phillipies and one summer in
      Austrailia.
    </p>
      <p> The first time I was in the US I was 14.  I came to Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimmaron.  Some people
      come to America and they get to see the Statue of Liberty. Others are welcomed by the Golden Gate Bridge.
      I got &quot;Chevy on a stick&quot;.

      <h2>Adulthood</h2>
      <p>
        My first forays into academia were as an undergraduate at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma.
        To say it was traumatizing is an understatement.  I wasn't prepared to shift from Living in Europe and
        the order of the military bases to the chaos of civilian life punctuated by a community where everything
        I am is offensive.  My first year I worked in the engineering computer lab.  It was unfathomably depressing
        so I became an RA.  After a semester of babysitting, I gave up.  It was at this time i took my first job in
        corrections at the county level.  I spent my weekends booking classmates for public intoxication mostly
        and overseeing drunk tank operations.  I found I enjoyed the work and switched majors, during my senior year
        of all things, to Criminal Justice and Pre-Law.  I became a seven-year senior.  In the end I left with three
        degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        After college I decided I didn't want to work at the county level and especially in Oklahoma.  So I appllied
        to the Federal Law Enforcment Training Center <abbr>FLETC.</abbr>  After twenty weeks of training, I took my
        first federal position in Molokai, HI.  I was there three years before moving to Federal Correctional Center <abbr>
        FCC</abbr> Brooklyn.  While I was there I worked on and got 2 masters degrees from New York University
        and City University of New York, John Jay College of Criminal Justice. My <abbr> NYU</abbr> is in
        Psychometrics and my <abbr>JJCCJ</abbr> degree is in Forensic Psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the course work for my Doctorate, I was transferred to the Federal Intake and Assessment
        Center<abbr>FIAC</abbr> Raymond in Southern Maine.  It was here that I adopted my son, Ari.  I was at <abbr>FIAC
        </abbr> Raymond until 2007 when I took the Wardens' Board, passed and was made underwarden at the old
        Federal Inmate Detention and Transfer Center<abbr>FIDTC</abbr> Albuquerque.  In 2013 I was diagnosed with Multiple
        Sclerosis and was medically retired.  My <abbr>MS</abbr> went into remission during the pandemic and was cleared
        to return to work in March of this year.  So I enrolled in this class.
